## Work Done till now

Till now,All related projects are integrated with the main project.Also, this is done with the organisational calendar.
Also in the main calendar widget, Project Code is shown with respect to each calendar type.

## Future Work

A strong work is required on differentiating different related project types(funding,funded) in the left panel.Also, in the main calendar widget we need to differentiate related project events from main project events(we all agreed in a meeting that a slight color change will work).
Also, a new panel should be there to enable/disable calendar types for all projects at once.Also, left panel will be made more friendly by putting colors near the types.

## Time Line

1 **4th July - 8th July** -  CheckBox will be moved to right side.While color boxes will be moved to left near the caledar type names.Also, For funded and funding projects different(blurred or whitened) colors will be provided.

2 **11th July - 15th July** - A different fold for every project in left panel with one checkbox that can enable/disable all calendar types of that project.

3 **18th July - 22nd July** - Different blocks for main , funding and funded projects with checkboxes that can toggle their calendar types.

4 **25th July - 29th July** - A panel will be provided that can toggle calendar types for all projects.
