## Summary
Finally decided to go with the change in mapping of Project Calendar Page request from enumMap to HashMap.This is done because a enumMap issending the just one projectId for every calendarType but we need to send all related project Ids.

## Work Done

1 EnumMap is converted to HashMap.

2 Successfully sent the all related project calendarType data to the caledarPresenter Class.

3 Also the calendarPresenter Class Page load functions (Reload & Reloadevents) are changed to Integer mapping.

4 Also tweaked orgUnit class according to changed conditions.

5 Also improved the Mock-Up on capture screen and by the help of pencil tool.
