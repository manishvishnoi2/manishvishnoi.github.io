## Summary
Fifth week was spent on projecting Project Code with their respective calendar types in main widget.This will help us to differentiate between different calendar types of different projects.

## Work Done

1 The project Code has been implemented.

2 New suggestion is to change the color of the funding and funded projects.

3 Also worked on the OrgUnit calendar where parent can see children calendar but not vice versa.

## Future Work

In coming weeks , the color of the related projects will be slightly differed from the main project entries.Also, related projects will be differentiated by whether they are funding or funded in the left panel.Also, all calendar type entries toggle will be provided.
A new mockup for above all will be presented soon.
