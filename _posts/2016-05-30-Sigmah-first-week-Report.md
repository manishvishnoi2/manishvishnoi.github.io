First week was majorly spent in group meetings with mentors as well as preparing environment setup.Also , Future roadmaps ,plans and mock-ups were prepared.

### Environment Setup

I was trying to setup development environment in Windows.The process was pretty easy and if you follow process described in the guide then it will be done within a day.The only problem i faced was at the time of login.
Login problem occured due to the new organization script which i think that was outdated.So i used the script which was in one of the PR by Olivier.After that sigmah environment works smoothly.

### Related Project Calendar Integration

Currently,Sigmah user cannot view activities and reminders associated with linked projects in Related project calendars.So the user has to access each linked projects calendar to look at events and reminders.By this integration,User will be able to look at all the events and reminders of all related projects in calendar sub­tab.Similarly no unification of calendars is available in organizational view.  

### Mock-Up

Mockup was prepared in Pencil - An open Source tool.Pencil is quite effective but i was learning it and for times sake prepared a very primitive mockup using only basic tools.Later on i learned to use screenshots and external plugins.
Preparing mockup gives the idea of how you are going to execute your idea.We discussed few ways in the meeting and finally decided that ProjectCode with every CalendarType is the corrct way.In meetings we decided that we have to show every calendarType component of every related funded and Funding projects while in the calendar widget every entry will be shown with the ProjectCode.A mockup is accordingly prepared.
